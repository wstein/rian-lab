# ADR-0054 — Connected REPL Prerequisites: attach authentication and an evaluation sandbox/fuel envelope

**Status:** Accepted (direction) · gates [ADR-0053 §2](0053-repl-interactive-surfaces.md) before `--remote` ships

## Context

[ADR-0053 §2](0053-repl-interactive-surfaces.md#2-a-connected-repl--the-differentiator) commits Rian to a *connected* REPL — `mix rian.repl --remote node@host` attaches to a running Rian/BEAM application and evaluates forms in its live context. That capability is the Clojure/IEx differentiator that ADR-0053 builds toward. It is also, by construction, **arbitrary code execution against a live node**: every form that lands at the prompt is parsed, type-checked, lowered, and applied inside the target VM's process tree.

ADR-0053 already lists the security concerns in its "Open items," but framing them alongside the feature work invites the false reading that the two tracks can ship in parallel — a `--remote` v1 today, hardening later. That sequencing is not defensible. A connected REPL without an answer to "who is allowed to attach and what are they allowed to run" is a remote shell with no audit trail and no fuel limit. Splitting the prerequisites into their own ADR makes the dependency explicit: ADR-0054 lands before `--remote` does, not alongside it.

This ADR does not specify the implementations — those are separate engineering projects that share concerns with the comptime sandbox (ADR-0030) and the LSP eval surface (ADR-0038). It specifies *what* must be true before `--remote` can ship and *which* questions each prerequisite has to answer.

## Decision

### 1. Attach authentication is a gating prerequisite

Before `mix rian.repl --remote node@host` is shipped, the connection path must answer all four:

* **Identity** — how is the connecting principal identified? At minimum: a credential the operator can revoke without restarting the node. SSH-key parity (the operator already trusts the OS user) is the floor; a Rian-issued attach token tied to the deploy identity is the direction.
* **Authorization** — which principals may attach to which node? Authorization is per-node and per-environment, not per-host: a dev node and a prod node never share an attach policy, and the policy is configuration that travels with the deploy, not local-machine state.
* **Audit trail** — every attach is logged with `{principal, node, started_at, ended_at}`. Every evaluated form is recorded with its source and the inferred effect set (ADR-0048). The log is structured (machine-queryable) and lives somewhere the operator can read it without the node's cooperation — a `--remote` session that can disable its own logging is not a `--remote` session that can ship.
* **Disconnect** — the operator can force-disconnect an attached session and revoke its credential without restarting the host node. A long-running form does not survive credential revocation.

### 2. Evaluation sandbox/fuel is a gating prerequisite

A `--remote` session must run within an envelope the host node enforces. Before `--remote` ships, the envelope must answer all four:

* **Effect scope** — which effects (ADR-0048) may the session perform? The default is the deploy's *least-privilege* effect set; widening is an explicit grant tied to the attach authorization. A session that lacks `:fs:write` cannot acquire it mid-evaluation by calling a host function that has it; effect checking happens at the evaluated form's boundary, not transitively swallowed by the callee.
* **Call scope** — which functions may the session call? Two cuts: (a) a *deny list* for known-dangerous primitives (`:os.cmd`, `:erlang.halt`, raw `:gen_tcp`); (b) a *project capability* — only modules the deploy itself exposed via its capability manifest are callable. The deny list is the safety net; the manifest is the model.
* **Fuel** — every evaluated form has a wall-clock cap, a reduction cap, and a memory-growth cap. A form that exceeds any cap is killed and reported back to the attached session; the host node is unaffected. Caps are per-form, not per-session, so a single runaway form doesn't take down the attach.
* **Determinism of failure** — a sandbox violation (effect, call, or fuel) is a *typed error result* at the prompt — `error: sandbox denied :fs:write at line 3` — never a silent no-op and never a crash that propagates beyond the attached form. The session continues unless the operator chooses otherwise.

### 3. The prerequisites compose with the rest of the platform

Both items above share design surface with existing ADRs and should be implemented as extensions of those, not as bespoke REPL infrastructure:

* The **comptime sandbox (ADR-0030)** already establishes the effect/call/fuel envelope for type-level execution. The connected REPL's envelope is the *same* envelope with a different policy default (least-privilege for prod attach; comptime trusts its compile-time host more). One sandbox implementation, two policies.
* The **LSP eval protocol (ADR-0038)** ships a form to a connected REPL — the editor-attach path is `--remote`'s richer sibling. Authentication and sandbox apply identically; the LSP message just substitutes for the terminal as the form's source.
* **Effect visibility (ADR-0048)** is the audit trail's vocabulary. Each logged form's effect set is what a reviewer reads to decide whether a session did what it said it would do. The connected REPL is one of the consumers that makes ADR-0048's existence load-bearing rather than aspirational.

### 4. Shipping order

1. Comptime sandbox (ADR-0030) lands. The connected REPL's call/fuel/effect-scope enforcement reuses it.
2. Effect checker (ADR-0048) lands. The audit trail can record meaningful effect sets per form.
3. Attach authentication lands as a stand-alone piece — usable on a fresh node for operator parity with `iex --remsh`, before any sandbox policy is applied.
4. Connected REPL `--remote` ships. Its default policy is least-privilege; widening requires explicit grants.

Steps 1 and 2 are themselves ordered with respect to the broader compiler roadmap; this ADR does not move their dates, only commits the connected REPL to following them.

## Status of options

| Option | Score (Marcus / Kira / Maya) |
|---|---|
| Ship `--remote` v1 with operator-level SSH-only auth, harden later | **rejected** (0/5 across the board — operator-level auth was never the gap; the gap is policy-aware authorization, audit, and an enforced eval envelope) |
| Build a bespoke REPL-only sandbox separate from ADR-0030 | 1/5 (parallel paths duplicate effect/call enforcement and will drift) |
| Make ADR-0030 and ADR-0048 hard prerequisites; ship `--remote` after both | **4/5** — accepted |
| Make ADR-0038 (LSP) a hard prerequisite too | 3/5 (LSP is a *consumer* of the same envelope, not a gating dependency for the terminal `--remote` flow) |

## Consequences

* **No `--remote` v1 before this ADR is satisfied.** Direction-only language in ADR-0053 §2 stays direction-only until both gating items above hold.
* **The comptime sandbox (ADR-0030) becomes load-bearing for more than comptime.** Its API surface should be designed with the connected REPL as a second consumer from day one, not retrofit later. (Practical impact: the sandbox configuration must be value-passable, not embedded in compile-time constants.)
* **The effect checker (ADR-0048) becomes the audit-trail vocabulary.** Its surface needs to be queryable from the host node at runtime (not only at compile), which slightly raises the API target above the original "compile-time only" framing.
* **Local `mix rian.repl` and `mix rian.repl --eval "EXPR"` are unaffected.** They run in a fresh node the developer started — there is no live application to sandbox against. The `--eval` trusted-input note in [`Mix.Tasks.Rian.Repl`](../../lib/mix/tasks/rian.repl.ex) covers that surface's threat model.

## Open items

* **Per-node policy schema.** Where does the deploy declare which principals can attach with which effect-set/manifest grants? Candidates: a sibling of the project's deploy descriptor; a capability-manifest extension; a separate `rian_attach.toml`. Decide when ADR-0030 lands and the comptime sandbox configuration shape stabilizes.
* **Multi-attach semantics.** Can two principals attach to the same node concurrently? If yes, are their effect-scope grants additive or independent? Default: independent (each session is sandboxed against the policy that granted its attach).
* **Backpressure on the audit log.** A high-frequency attached session can produce a lot of structured events. Drop-on-overflow vs block-the-eval is a policy decision; default to *block*, on the principle that "no audit, no eval" is the right side of the trade.
* **Attach-token rotation.** Mechanism and default rotation interval — likely the same answer as the deploy's secrets-rotation story; should not be solved twice.
